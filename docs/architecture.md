# GitHub Actions Testing and Reporting Platform

## Overview
This project implements a proof-of-concept GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing and reporting. The system processes test results, generates reports, and delivers notifications through multiple channels.

## System Architecture

### 1. Webhook Service
- **Endpoint**: Handles incoming GitHub Actions payloads
- **Validation**: Authenticates and validates webhook data
- **Queue Integration**: Routes validated payloads to BullMQ queues

### 2. Message Queue System
- **Technology**: BullMQ backed by Redis
- **Queue Structure**:
  - Separate queues for each notification channel (Discord, Email)
  - Redis as the message broker
  - Scalable worker architecture

### 3. Worker System
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Process queued jobs
  - Handle channel-specific notification logic
  - Manage retries and error handling
- **Channels**:
  - Discord notifications
  - Email notifications

### 4. Test Results Collection
- **Storage**:
  - GitHub Actions artifacts
  - Test result JSON files
  - Screenshots and logs
- **Processing**:
  - Automated parsing scripts
  - Data aggregation
  - Metrics extraction

### 5. Reporting System
- **Report Generation**:
  - Markdown format
  - Key metrics inclusion
  - Test run summaries
- **Distribution**:
  - Server submission
  - Channel-specific formatting

### 6. Failure Notification System
- **Trigger Conditions**:
  - Test failures
  - System errors
  - Performance thresholds
- **Implementation**:
  - GitHub Actions `if: failure()` condition
  - Multi-channel notifications
  - Priority routing

## Integration Points
1. GitHub Actions
2. Discord API
3. Email Service
4. Redis
5. Reporting Server

## Deployment Requirements
- Redis instance
- Node.js environment
- GitHub Actions runner
- Notification service credentials
